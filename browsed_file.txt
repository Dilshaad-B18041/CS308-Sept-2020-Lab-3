Our analysis of tax incidence, however, shows that lawmakers cannot so eas-
ily dictate the distribution of a tax burden. To illustrate, we can analyze a payroll
tax as merely a tax on a good, where the good is labor and the price is the wage.
The key feature of the payroll tax is that it places a wedge between the wage that
firms pay and the wage that workers receive. Figure 8 shows the outcome. When
a payroll tax is enacted, the wage received by workers falls, and the wage paid
by firms rises. In the end, workers and firms share the burden of the tax, much as
the legislation requires. Yet this division of the tax burden between workers and
firms has nothing to do with the legislated division: The division of the burden in
Figure 8 is not necessarily fifty-fifty, and the same outcome would prevail if the
law levied the entire tax on workers or if it levied the entire tax on firms.
